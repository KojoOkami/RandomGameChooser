# Random Game Chooser

Own **TOO** many games?

Get that feeling of never knowing what to play?

Overwelmed?

Your SO wants you to choose a game purely because they don't want to choose a game but they are the picky one in the relationship so you don't want to pick either but you just want to play something?

Then enter the game options you have into this web app and hit the randomize button a few times until it lands on a game that you would actually consider playing!

# Why I Made This

I have been needing to learn React + Node and thought this would be a good simple idea to create.

The idea for this came to me when I was told to make a decision that I didn't want to make for *reasons*.

I don't think anyone is actually going to use it (including me) but it is good practice and learning regardless.
